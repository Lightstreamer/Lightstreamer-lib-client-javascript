This Node.js library enables any Node.js application to communicate bidirectionally with the Lightstreamer Server.
The API allows to subscribe to real-time data pushed by the server and to send any message to the server.
The library is distributed through the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/lightstreamer-client-node" target="_top">npm service</a>.

The Node.js library can be available depending on Edition and License Type. To know what features are enabled by your license, please see the License tab of the Monitoring Dashboard (by default, available at /dashboard).

To have a quick overview of the library, start digging into the API from the {@link LightstreamerClient} object.

Check out the available <a href="http://demos.lightstreamer.com/?p=lightstreamer&t=client&a=nodejsclient">examples</a> and associated README to learn more.

If there is any issue, you can find a solution on <a href="http://forums.lightstreamer.com/forumdisplay.php?11-JavaScript-Client-API" target="_top">our public forum</a>.

Note the following documentation convention:
<BR>Function arguments qualified as `<optional>` can be omitted only if not followed by further arguments.
In some cases, arguments that can be omitted (subject to the same restriction) may not be qualified as `<optional>`, but their optionality will be clear from the description.
