<div class="version">8.0.2 build 1784</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 7.0.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<div class="date">Released on 11 Dec 2019</div>

<p id="3100">Revised the policy of reconnection attempts to reduce the attempt frequency
in case of repeated failure of the first bind request, which could be due to issues
in accessing the "control link" (when configured).</p>


<div class="version">8.0.1 build 1774</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 7.0.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<div class="date">Released on 9 October 2019</div>

<p id="3078">Fixed a bug which could have caused the client to ignore a call to 
LightstreamerClient.disconnect, when it was invoked while the client was reconnecting,
that is, when LightstreamerClient.getStatus was equal to DISCONNECTED:WILL-RETRY or
DISCONNECTED:TRYING-RECOVERY.</p>

<p id="3082">Fixed a bug which could have caused the ClientListener.onStatusChange callback
to notify the status DISCONNECTED:WILL-RETRY as the first status instead of CONNECTING.
The anomaly could be triggered by invoking LightstreamerClient.disconnect while the client
was trying to recover the session, and then invoking LightstreamerClient.connect.</p>

<p id="3076"> 
Fixed a bug which could have caused the client to disconnect abruptly when the server signaled 
a harmless error message.</p>

<p>Revised and improved the layout of the jsdocs.</p>


<div class="version">8.0.0 build 1771.1012</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 7.0.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<div class="date">Released on 30 August 2019</div>

<p>Replaced the "maxBandwidth" property of the ConnectionOptions bean with two
   distinct properties: "requestedMaxBandwidth" and the read-only "realMaxBandwidth",
   so that the setting is made with the former, while the value applied by
   the Server is only reported by the latter, now including changes during session
   life. The extension affects the getter and setter names and also the invocations
   of onPropertyChange on the ClientListener (see the docs for details).
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Custom code using "maxBandwidth"
   in any of the mentioned forms has to be ported.</span></p>

<p>Introduced a new callback, "onRealMaxFrequency", to the SubscriptionListener,
   to report the frequency constraint on the subscription as determined by the
   Server and its changes during subscription life. See the docs for details
   and special cases.</p>

<p id="3042">Fixed a bug introduced with the session recovery mechanism,
   which, under certain conditions, could have caused the client to ignore
   the setForcedTransport setting after a recovery attempt, even a successful one.</p>

<p id="3063">Removed a spurious notification of the DISCONNECTED:WILL-RETRY
   state that could occur when invoking connect() after receiving an invocation
   of onServerError(). The bug was harmless.</p>

<p>Introduced a new property, "clientIp", in the ConnectionDetails bean;
   it is a read-only property with the related getter and keyword for
   onPropertyChange (see the docs for details).</p>

<p>Slightly delayed the availability of the "serverSocketName" property of the
   ConnectionDetails bean, which was already valued upon session start.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Custom code using
   getServerSocketName right after a session start, should ensure that
   onPropertyChange for "serverSocketName" gets invoked first.</span></p>
   
<p>Removed useless requests to the Server for bandwidth change when the Server
   is not configured for bandwidth management.</p>
   
<p>Added the error code 21 in onServerError, that can be received upon some failed
   requests, to inform that not only the current session was not found but it is also likely
   that the request was routed to the wrong Server instance. Previously, in the same cases,
   the SDK library would not invoke onServerError and would open a new session instead.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: If using an existing application, you should
   check how it would handle the new (and unexpected) error code. A reconnection attempt would
   ensure the previous behavior, although this is no longer the suggested action.</span></p>

<p>Added new error codes 66 and 68 to onServerError, onSubscriptionError, and
   onSecondLevelSubscriptionError, to report server-side issues; previously,
   upon such problems, the connection was just interrupted.<br/>
   Added new error code 61 to onServerError, to report unexpected client-side issues;
   previously, upon such problems, the connection was just interrupted.<br/>
   Removed error code 20 from onSubscriptionError and onSecondLevelSubscriptionError
   documentation; when a subscription request cannot find the session,
   the session is just closed and replaced immediately.</p>

<p id="3031">By-passed the "retry delay" setting when recovering from a closed session.
   This may speedup the recovery process.</p>

<p>Clarified in the docs the role of the delayTimeout in sendMessage.</p>

<p>Incremented the minor version number.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: If running the Server with a license
   of "file" type which enables Node.js Client SDK up to version 7.3 or earlier, clients based
   on this new version will not be accepted by the Server: a license upgrade will be needed.</span></p>


<div class="version">7.3.1 build 1767</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 7.0.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<div class="date">Released on 3 Apr 2019</div>

<p>Fixed a bug in the recently revised policy of reconnection attempts upon failed
   or unresponsive requests. In case of multiple failed attempts on unresponsive connections
   the retry delay was increased dynamically, but was not restored to the configured
   value after a successful connection. As a consequence, after a server or network
   unavailability lasting for a couple of minutes, further cases of server or network
   unavailability would be recovered in about one minute, even if much shorter.</p>

<p>Fixed an annoying formatting issue in the jsdoc page for ConnectionOptions.</p>


<div class="version">7.3.0 build 1766</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 7.0.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<div class="date">Released on 14 Mar 2019</div>

<p>Fixed a bug causing the conversion into numbers of user-supplied string parameters 
   (e.g. in settings in ConnectionDetails and ConnectionOptions) which can be interpreted
   as numbers. For example a user name of the form '1e2' could have been converted into
   the number 100, then used as the string '100'.</p>

<p>Fixed several bugs in the session recovery mechanism:
   </p><ul>
   <li>Fixed a bug which could have caused, in case of a recovery failure
   due to the elapsing of the recently added "SessionRecoveryTimeout" setting, 
   the failure of the first subsequent attempt to create a new session.</li>
   <li>Fixed a bug causing the client to always try a recovery when the ReconnectTimeout
   expired on a stalled session, regardless that the SessionRecoveryTimeout could be set
   as 0 to disable session recovery.</li>
   <li>Fixed a bug that could have caused the silent discarding of control requests (e.g. subscriptions
   or messages) when the client was attempting the recovery of the current session.</li>
   <li>Fixed a bug that could have caused session recovery to fail if preceded by a previous
   successful session recovery on the same session by more than a few seconds.</li>
   <li>Fixed a bug triggered by a call to connect() or setForcedTransport() issued while the client
   was attempting the recovery of the current session. This caused the recovery to fail,
   but, then, the library might not reissue the current subscriptions on the newly created session.</li>
   </ul>

<p>Fixed a bug due to a race condition between a subscribe and a concurrent disconnect,
   which could have caused the subscription to be skipped upon a subsequent connect.</p>

<p>Modified the implementation of connect() when issued while the state is either
   DISCONNECTED:WILL-RETRY or DISCONNECTED:TRYING-RECOVERY. The call will no longer interrupt
   the pending reconnection attempt, but it will be ignored, to lean on the current attempt.
   Note that a pending reconnection attempt can still be interrupted by issuing disconnect() first.<br/>
   Modified in a similar way the implementation of setForcedTransport(); when issued
   while the state is either DISCONNECTED:WILL-RETRY or DISCONNECTED:TRYING-RECOVERY,
   the call will no longer interrupt the pending reconnection attempt, but it will apply
   to the outcome of that connection attempt.</p>

<p>Wholly revised the policy of reconnection attempts upon failed or unresponsive requests.
   Now the only property related with this policy is "RetryDelay", which now affects both
   (1) the minimum time to wait before trying a new connection to the Server in case the previous one failed 
   for any reason and (2) the maximum time to wait for a response to a request before dropping the connection 
   and trying with a different approach.<br/>
   Previously, point (2) was related with the "ConnectTimeout" and "CurrentConnectTimeout" properties.
   Now, in case of multiple failed attempts on unresponsive connections (i.e. while in CONNECTING state),
   the timeout used may still be increased dynamically and can still be inspected through
   getCurrentConnectTimeout, but this behavior is no longer configurable.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing code that tries to take control of the
   connection timeouts will no longer be obeyed, but we assume that the new policy will bring
   an overall improvement. Note that, when in CONNECTING state, the current timeout can be restored
   by issuing disconnect() and then connect().</span>
   As a result of the change, methods setConnectTimeout, getConnectTimeout and setCurrentConnectTimeout 
   of ConnectionOptions have been deprecated, as the setters have no effect and the getter
   is now equivalent to getRetryDelay.<br/>
   Also changed the default value of the "RetryDelay" property from 2 seconds to 4 seconds.</p>

<p>Changed the default value of the "EarlyWSOpenEnabled" property from true to false 
   (see ConnectionOptions.setEarlyWSOpenEnabled). This removes a potential incompatibility
   with cookie-based Load Balancers, at the expense of a possible slight delay in session startup.</p>

<p>Changed the default value of the "SlowingEnabled" property from true to false 
   (see ConnectionOptions.setSlowingEnabled).</p>

<p>Incremented the minor version number.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: If running the Server with a license
   of "file" type which enables Node.js Client SDK up to version 7.2 or earlier, clients based
   on this new version will not be accepted by the Server: a license upgrade will be needed.</span></p>


<div class="version">7.2.4 build 1757</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 7.0.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<div class="date">Released on 7 Jun 2018</div>

<p>Introduced a maximum time on attempts to recover the current session, after which
   a new session will be opened. The default is 15 seconds, but it can be customized
   with the newly added "SessionRecoveryTimeout" property in ConnectionOptions.
   This fixes a potential case of permanently unsuccessful recovery, if the
   &lt;control_link_address&gt; setting were leveraged in a Server cluster and a Server
   instance happened to leave a cluster and were not automatically restarted.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug in the recently introduced session recovery mechanism triggered
   by the use of the &lt;control_link_address&gt; setting on the Server,
   which could have caused feasible recovery attempts to fail.</p>

<p>Fixed a harmless bug, introduced in the previous version, which could have caused
   a Server warning for "duplicated LS_session" on some client requests.</p>


<div class="version">7.2.3 build 1750</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 7.0.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<div class="date">Released on 17 Apr 2018</div>

<p>Fixed a bug in the recently introduced session recovery mechanism, by which,
   a sendMessage request issued while a recovery operation was in place,
   could have never been notified to the listener until the end of the session
   (at which point an "abort" notification would have been issued to the listener),
   even in case the recovery was successful.</p>

<p>Fixed a race condition, mostly possible while a session recovery was being
   attempted, which could have caused the delay of subscription requests
   due to a wrong request to the Server.</p>

<p>Addressed a particular case of session interruption that was still not supported
   by the session recovery feature.</p>


<div class="version">7.2.2 build 1747</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 7.0.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<div class="date">Released on 23 Mar 2018</div>

<p>Fixed a severe bug in the recently introduced session recovery mechanism, by which,
   after the creation of a new session because of network issues, it was possible
   that subsequent successful session recovery would cause data loss.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug in the recently introduced session recovery mechanism, which,
   upon particular kinds of network issues and if the creation of a new session
   had been necessary, could have caused the client to skip the resuming of the
   active subscriptions.</p>

<p>Fixed an annoying typo in the documentation of onStatusChange regarding the
   "DISCONNECTED:TRYING-RECOVERY" status.</p> 

<p>Improved the library log by splitting the "lightstreamer.subscriptions" category in three,
   with the introduction of "lightstreamer.messages" and "lightstreamer.requests".
   See setLoggerProvider in LightstreamerClient for details.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing code that collects log
   from the "lightstreamer.subscriptions" category should be ported. This obviously
   is not expected to affect production code.</span></p>


<div class="version">7.2.1 build 1745</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 7.0 b2.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<div class="date">Released on 22 Feb 2018</div>

<p>Added the error code 21 in onServerError, that can be received upon failed bind
   requests, to inform that not only the current session was not found but it is also likely
   that the request was routed to the wrong Server instance. Previously, in the same cases,
   the SDK library would not invoke onServerError and would open a new session instead.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: In these cases, existing applications
   will no longer benefit from the automatic recovery, unless they are extended to handle
   the new event properly.</span><br/>
   Likewise, added the error code 11 in onSubscriptionError and onCommandSecondLevelSubscriptionError,
   that can be received instead of code 20, to inform that not only the current session
   was not found but it is also likely that the request was routed to the wrong Server instance.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing applications which handle
   error code 20, should ensure that the new error code 11 is also handled properly.</span></p>

<p>Modified the default value of the "RetryDelay" property from 5000 to 2000 ms.
   This should help recovering from network outages of a few seconds, typical, for
   instance, of wifi/mobile network switches on mobile phones.</p>

<p>Extended the recovery mechanism to stalled sessions. Now, when the ReconnectTimeout
   expires, an attempt to recover the current session will be performed first.</p>

<p>Fixed a race condition, introduced in the previous build 1737, which could have caused
   the delay of subscription requests issued on a websocket session startup
   due to a wrong request to the Server.</p>

<p>Improved the notification of closed sessions to the Server.</p>


<div class="version">7.2.0 build 1743</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 7.0 b2.</div>
<div class="compatibility">May not be compatible with code developed with the previous version;
   see compatibility notes below.</div>
<div class="date">Released on 20 Dec 2017</div>

<p>Added automatic recovery of sessions upon unexpected socket interruption during
   streaming or long polling. Now the library will perform an attempt to resume
   the session from the interruption point. The attempt may or may not succeed,
   also depending on the Server configuration of the recovery capability.<br/>
   As a consequence, introduced a new status, namely DISCONNECTED:TRYING-RECOVERY,
   to inform the application when a recovery attempt is being performed; hence,
   onStatusChange and getStatus can provide the new status.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Existing code that uses the status
   names received via onStatusChange or getStatus may have to be aligned.</span></p>
   
<p>Extended the reverse heartbeat mechanism, governed by the "ReverseHeartbeatInterval"
   property. Now, it will also allow the Server to detect when a client has abandoned
   a session although the socket remains open.<br/>
   Fixed a bug on sending reverse heartbeats to the Server, which, sometimes, could
   have caused the Server to report a syntax error.</p>

<p>Added the new Server error code 71 to onServerError and clarified the difference
   with error code 60.</p>

<p>Fixed the documentation of the "ContentLength", "KeepaliveInterval", and
   "ReverseHeartbeatInterval" properties of ConnectionOptions, to clarify that
   a zero value is not allowed in the first and it is allowed in the others.</p>

<p>Improved subscription requests on WebSockets by removing unnecessary parts.</p>

<p>Aligned the documentation to comply with current licensing policies.</p>


<div class="version">7.1.1 build 1732.7</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 6.0.2.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<div class="date">Released on 20 Nov 2017</div>

<p>Removed all the occurrences of the deprecated "with" statement, erroneously 
   reintroduced in version 7.1.0.</p>

<p>Ensured source compatibility with React Native up to version 0.49.</p>


<div class="version">7.1.0 build 1732</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 6.0.2.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<div class="date">Released on 25 May 2017</div>

<p>Fixed the recently added support for cookie handling on WebSocket connections,
   to be fully compliant in the determination of outgoing cookies.</p>

<p>Added static methods addCookies and getCookies to LightstreamerClient,
   to simplify the sharing of cookies between Server connections operated by
   the SDK library and the rest of the application.</p>


<div class="version">7.0.9 build 1729</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 6.0.2.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<div class="date">Released on 15 May 2017</div>

<p>Improved the handling of cookies, by adding support of the WebSocket case.
   Now, the invocation of setCookieHandlingRequired(true) no longer causes the
   library to keep from using WebSockets.<br/>
   Clarified in the docs for setHttpExtraHeaders how custom cookies can be set
   and inquired, which is also how cookies set by other sites can be supplied.</p>

<p>Added the error code 60 to "onServerError", to report cases in which the
   Server license does not allow the client version.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug on the recovery of control requests upon session close and replacement,
   which, through a rare race condition, could have caused the block of all subsequent
   control requests.</p>


<div class="version">7.0.7 build 1722</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 6.0.2.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<div class="date">Released on 17 Mar 2017</div>

<p>Removed all the occurrences of the deprecated "with" statement in order to ensure 
Javascript strict mode compatibility.</p>


<div class="version">7.0.6 build 1719</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 6.0.2.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<div class="date">Released on 7 Mar 2017</div>

<p>Fixed a bug which caused the invocations to the "setReconnectTimeout" method
   in ConnectionOptions to be ignored.</p>

<p>Removed the polyfill of the Promise, which is no longer needed, yet it might
   have caused compatibility issues in some environments.</p>


<div class="version">7.0.5 build 1718</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 6.0.2.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<div class="date">Released on 16 Jan 2017</div>

<p>Removed a restriction on field names that can be supplied to a Subscription object
   within a "field list"; names made by numbers are now allowed.
   Obviously, the final validation on field names is made by the Metadata Adapter.</p>


<div class="version">7.0.4 build 1717</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 6.0.2.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<div class="date">Released on 9 Jan 2017</div>

<p>Fixed a bug introduced in version 6.1 which prevented the "slowing algorithm"
   (see setSlowingEnabled) from working.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug in setRequestedBufferSize, which caused the value "unlimited" to be
   ignored for subscriptions in MERGE mode, which would stick to the default buffer
   size of 1.</p>
   
<p>Fixed the handling of wrong calls to getFields and getFieldSchema on Subscription.
   In some cases, an exception different from the IllegalStateException was thrown.</p>

<p>Fixed the log produced by the library, as, between the window name (when available)
   and the timestamp a space was missing.</p>

<p>Revised the sendMessage implementation in the HTTP case, to limit recovery actions
   when messages are not to be ordered and a listener is not provided.<br/>
   Revised sendMessage to accept 0 as a legal value for the "delayTimeout" argument.</p>

<p>Revised the default setting for the "ContentLength" property of ConnectionOptions,
   to allow the library to set it to the best value.</p>

<p>Clarified in the documentation the meaning of null in setRequestedMaxFrequency
   and setRequestedBufferSize. Extended setRequestedMaxFrequency to allow the setting
   also when the subscription is "active" and the current value is null.</p>

<p>Revised the documentation of possible subscription error codes.</p>

<p>Added clarification details in the documentation of setCookieHandlingRequired.</p>


<div class="version">7.0.3 build 1712</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 6.0.2.</div>
<div class="compatibility">Compatible with code developed with the previous version.</div>
<div class="date">Released on 10 May 2016</div>
   
<p>Introduced the new Node.js SDK. See the "sdk_client_nodejs_unified" folder.<br/>
   Previously, the Node.js library was available as part of the SDK for JavaScript Clients,
   now called SDK for Web Clients (Unified API).<br/>
   Note that the library was released in two different versions: as a "flavour" of the
   JavaScript Client Library and through the npm service. This SDK only refers to the library
   deployed via npm. However, currently, the use of the Web (Unified API) Client Library in the
   Node.js flavour, which is based on AMD, is not recommended.<br/>
   The Client Library has the same characteristics of the library in the current
   SDK for Web Clients (Unified API) version 7.0.2 and you can refer to that SDK for the
   changelog with respect to previous versions (although some topics in that changelog,
   obviously, don't pertain to Node.js), with the following additions:
   </p><ul>
   <li>There is no licensing restriction on the library version
   in use when a license file is configured on the Server. But note that if trying to access
   a Server with Server version earlier than 6.0.2 a license error will be issued by the Server.</li>
   <li>Methods enableSharing and isMaster for the LightstreamerClient class are not available.
   <span class="compatibility">COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Custom code targeted for the Node.js
   environment was not expected to request connection sharing, which is not supported there.</span></li>
   <li>Some dependency third-party libraries have been upgraded.</li>
   <li>Requests in HTTP now support cookie handling also in the Node.js environment.
   As a consequence, invocations of setCookieHandlingRequired(true) in class ConnectionOptions
   are now allowed, although they would disable the use of WebSocket, for which cookie handling
   is still not implemented.</li>
   </ul>
